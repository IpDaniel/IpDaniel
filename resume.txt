I am a first-year student at Northeastern University. I am majoring in computer science and business with a
concentration in finance, which is representative of my most notable passions, interests, and experiences.
I have been fascinated by computers since middle school, and first taught myself to code the summer after eighth
grade. From there I expanded my computer science activities to include proficiency in 6 programming languages,
and many various applications ranging from machine learning algorithms, to chatbots, to video game mods. My fascination with business and finance came about in high school, partially as a result of my social and physical
proximity to the world of economics and finance. The main ways I fostered my passion were through stock trading,
socially engaging in various finance communities, and educating myself by reading books(mostly classics like Graham
and Dodd's The Intelligent Investor, or Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street).
I now attend Northeastern University as an undergraduate student where I seek to gain the skills and knowledge I
need for a successful career doing what I love.

WAKE UP MATTRESS Went through full engineering design and development process as part of a team of 3 to research and establish the
issue of waking up in the morning. Then went on to design and prototype a potential solution: an alarm connected to
a set of load cells under a mattress, and a diffused led light. The light and alarm will go off in the morning and only
turn off when the load cells under the mattress detect that the user has gotten out of bed. Will turn back on if the
user attempts to get back in bed and remain in the active state for a period of time set by the user prior to the alarm
being triggered.
METHOD EDUCATORS
Purchased domains, built website, set up mailing system, created course content, found employees, and briefly ran
Facebook ads for a self-started SAT tutoring, and academic tutoring business. Had to stop before any clients were
acquired because of personal time constraints and Facebook ad account bans. Website is still active:
